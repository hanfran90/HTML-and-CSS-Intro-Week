            <h3>History</h3>
                <p>Whippets, as with all sighthounds, were bred to hunt by a sight-driven prey instinct, coursing game in open areas at very high speeds. There are numerous representations of smallish, sighthound-like hunting dogs in Ancient Egyptian artworks dating back thousands of years, possibly portraying ancient forms of greyhound, basenji, Pharaoh hound or saluki.</p>
            
            <h3>Whippet Racing</h3>
                <p>Dog racing was originally an extension of hare coursing. Whippets began to be bred to race in the mid-nineteenth century. The first form of the sport was a rudimentary form of coursing known as 'ragging', and dogs who participated were said to be 'trained to the rag'. Dogs were kept on a leash by a person known as a slip, who was frequently also the race judge. The slip would release the dogs from their collars at the same time, and they would race towards their owners, who were standing at the opposite end of the track waving towels.</p>

            <h3>Breed Description</h3>
                 <h4>Appearance</h4>
                     <p>The Whippet is a medium-sized dog: the ideal height for bitches is 44 to 47 cm (17.5 to 18.5 in), and for dogs 47 to 51 cm (18.5 to 20 in).[32][33] The standards of the American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel Club allow for larger animals, with an upper limit of 55 cm (21.5 in) for bitches and 57 cm (22.5 in) for dogs.Because colour is considered immaterial in judging Whippets, they come in a wide variety of colours and marking patterns, everything from solid black to solid white, with red, fawn, brindle, blue, or cream. The coat is short, smooth and close.</p>
                 <h4>Temperament</h4>
                    <p>Whippets are quiet and reserved but also exhibit a playful side, and require regular exercise. They are generally gentle dogs and are often content to spend much of the day resting. The AKC describes them as "quiet and dignified in their owner's living room" and says they make "excellent house dogs." Whippets have been called a "poor man's racehorse" by the colliers in Lancashire and Yorkshire.</p>
